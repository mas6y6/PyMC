This is a minecraft server installer and more

Its a solution to minecraft server files editing and maintenance, and helps you to setup a minecraft server WAY faster and easier
then the manual way

**Please read all of the documentation before running PyMC-Server**

![PyMC-Server](https://github.com/mas6y6/PyMC-Server/assets/125225333/f176d3ea-7327-4dec-8012-50fcf5d0042b)

# How to run
Its very simple just download the `PyMC-Server.py file` located in `PyMC-Server-Download` folder and run this one command and you get into the setup process

```
python3 PyMC-Server.py
```

# Important!!
Please don't delete the `settings.json` file or the PyMC-Server will forget that you made a server, where it is and it will break the installer

# Features
1. This installer has a setup system that guides you through the setup process instead of manually setting up the minecraft server

2. This installer has a main menu function that helps you edit, start and update the server

3. This installer has a server updater that automatically updates the server when a new version or build releases

4. This installer will alert you when there is a new update for your installer **Not the server**

5. Instead of manually writing the `server.properties` file there is a Server settings menu in the main menu which makes it easier to change your server settings
